# Neaural Networks and Deep Learning

## Overview

Using neural networks and, more specifically, deep learning models, this project is aimed to create a relatively reliable binary classifier on a dataset consisting of numerical and categorical data. The process includes the steps of preprocessing data and then desigining, testing, and evaluating the results of models. Subject data pertained to organizations that received donations from a large corporation for specific projects. Parameters included data describing the recipient organization and the status, whether successful or unsuccessful, of the project. The goal of the analysis was to create a model that predicts, with relative accuracy, the likelihood of successful impleementation of projects funded by corporate donation.

Project goals included:

- Importing, analyzing, cleaning, and preprocesings a “real-world” classification dataset.
- Selecting, designing, and training a binary classification model.
- Optimizing model training and input data to achieve desired model performance.
